The two 3D printed parts are the main box cover and the rear cover, 
which serve important functions in the overall design.

The main box cover is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. As it 
interlocks with the main box, it helps to hold the servomotor in place, 
ensuring that it remains stable during use. This is essential for accurate 
and reliable manipulation of objects or instruments with the thimble.

The rear cover, on the other hand, was designed with two main purposes in mind. 
Firstly, it covers the servomotor cable and holds it in place with glue, as 
the quality of cable soldering is notoriously poor. This ensures that the 
cable remains securely in place, preventing any unwanted movement or 
disconnection during use. Secondly, the rear cover hosts the Velcro strip 
that is used to secure the thimble to the finger. This allows for easy and 
comfortable use of the thimble, ensuring that it remains securely attached 
to the finger throughout use.
