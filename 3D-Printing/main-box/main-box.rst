Main Box
++++++++

The main box is the central 3D printed part which houses directly the motor 
and accomodate the shape of our finger.
You can download the .stl file :download:`here <finger-servo-adapter.stl>`.

The function of this 3D printed part is to provide a mechanical linkage 
between the servomotor and the finger and ensure that the actuation part is 
precisely aligned with the fingertip pulp. The 3D printed part serves as a 
connector that translates the rotational motion of the servomotor into a 
precise alignment with the fingertip, resulting in accurate and consistent 
squeezing of the fingertip pulp.
