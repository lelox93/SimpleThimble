Rack and Pinion
++++++++

These two 3D printed parts are the rack and pinion, which will be mounted 
inside the thimble to convert the rotary motion of a servomotor into linear 
motion. The rack is a toothed bar that meshes with the pinion, a gear with a 
small number of teeth. When the pinion rotates, it drives the rack in a linear 
motion, resulting in precise and controlled movement of the thimble.

The rack and pinion mechanism is commonly used in mechanical systems to 
convert rotary motion to linear motion. In this particular case, it is used 
to translate the rotational motion of the servomotor to a linear motion that 
can be used to manipulate objects or instruments with the thimble. The 3D 
printed parts are designed to fit precisely inside the thimble and mesh 
smoothly with each other, ensuring reliable and accurate conversion of motion.

In addition to converting rotary motion to linear motion, the rack and pinion 
mechanism also includes an ergonomic fingertip envelope at the end of the rack. 
This envelope is designed to apply equal pressure on all surfaces of the 
fingertip, ensuring precise and controlled manipulation of objects or instruments. 
The design of the 3D printed parts takes into account both functionality and 
comfort, allowing for efficient and ergonomic use.

The design of these 3D printed parts was also done with ease of printing in mind, 
using fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. This method allows for quick 
and precise production of parts using a variety of materials. The design takes 
into account the limitations of FDM printing, ensuring that the parts can be 
printed easily and without errors. This ensures that the parts are readily 
available and easy to produce, making them a cost-effective and accessible 
solution for converting rotary motion to linear motion.
