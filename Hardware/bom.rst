.. tip:: 
    Doing a project with friends can be a great way to lower the cost for each participant. By pooling resources and splitting the cost of materials, you can save money and still get the job done. Plus, you'll have the added benefit of having friends to help you out and provide moral support. Working together can also help you stay motivated and on track, so you can finish the project faster and with better results. So why not get your friends together and start your project today?

Even though the total is **104,5 €** in materials, we advice the reader that some costly items (such as the LiPo battery or the microcontroller) are sold in more than one unit. The cost for a single pair of thimbles could be reduced to under **30 €**.
