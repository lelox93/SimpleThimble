Welcome to the hardware assembly section!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this section we will guide you to put together all the components to make the Simple Thimble!

.. caution::
    The project mechanics has been designed to be self produced with low-cost FDM (fused deposition modeling) 3D printing

.. danger:: 
    To obtain properly working 3D printed mechanical parts, you may need to file some parts to make them fit together. Moreover, soldering parts is needed to make this project.
    Always wear the proper **safety equipment**. This includes ``safety glasses`` to protect your eyes from flying debris, a ``face mask`` to protect your lungs from fumes, and ``gloves`` to protect your hands from heat and sharp edges. Additionally, it is important to work in a *well-ventilated* area to reduce the risk of inhaling toxic fumes.

Tools Required 
=============== 
* Soldering Iron 
* Solder 
* Wire Strippers 


Assembly Instructions 
========================== 

.. note:: 
    Some assembly instructions can be swapped without affecting the final result. This is because the order of instructions does not always matter. For example, if two instructions are independent of each other, they can be swapped without changing the outcome.

Step 1: Create the servomotor-pinion assembly
-------------------------------------------------

The first step to build our thimble is to attach the pinion to the servomotor shaft.
