Assembly Instructions 
--------------------- 

.. note:: 
    Some assembly instructions can be swapped without affecting the final result. This is because the order of instructions does not always matter. For example, if two instructions are independent of each other, they can be swapped without changing the outcome.

1. Solder the 9V battery connector to the Arduino Uno. 
2. Connect the haptic motor to the breadboard using the male-to-male connectors. 
3. Connect the 10K ohm resistor to the breadboard using the female-to-male connectors. 
4. Connect the push button to the breadboard using the male-to-female connectors. 
5. Connect the jumper wires to the haptic motor, 10K ohm resistor, and push button using the female-to-female connectors. 
6. Connect the jumper wires to the Arduino Uno using the assorted wire. 
7. Attach the 3D printed thimble to your finger using tape or glue.
