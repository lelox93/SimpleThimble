Here we will see how to setup softwares to work together. Those softwares all come for free at the price to create a personal account on their websites.

Install Unity softwares
========================

The first step is to install the Unity IDE. We will do it by using the Unity Hub, which is a software which allows us to mange Unity installations 
supporting also several version in the same computer. You can download the Unity Hub for windows by 
clicking `here <https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe?_ga=2.85170649.1955100606.1682932923-1536020329.1682932923>`_, and 
for Mac by clicking `here <https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.dmg?_ga=2.55320299.1955100606.1682932923-1536020329.1682932923>`_

After the installations is done, you can install the specific version of Unity which we used to develope this VR application, which is the 
Unity **2020.3.28f1** (64-bit). You can download this specific version by opening the Unity Hub and clicking `here <unityhub://2020.3.28f1/f5400f52e03f>`_.
