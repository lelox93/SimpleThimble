   The function of this 3D printed part is to provide a mechanical linkage 
   between the servomotor and the finger and ensure that the actuation part is 
   precisely aligned with the fingertip pulp. The 3D printed part serves as a 
   connector that translates the rotational motion of the servomotor into a 
   precise alignment with the fingertip, resulting in accurate and consistent 
   squeezing of the fingertip pulp.
