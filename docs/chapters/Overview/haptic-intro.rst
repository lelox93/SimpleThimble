Haptic Devices: an overview
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Haptic devices are tactile feedback devices that allow users to interact with virtual environments. They provide a sense of touch and force feedback to the user, allowing them to feel the effects of their actions in a virtual environment. Haptic devices are used in a variety of applications, including gaming, medical training, and virtual reality.

What is an haptic thimble?
===========================

A haptic thimble is a device used to provide tactile feedback to a user. It is typically worn on the finger and provides a physical sensation when 
interacting with a virtual environment. The thimble can be used to simulate the feeling of touching objects in a virtual world, allowing users to experience a more realistic and immersive experience.

We can find two simple implementations of an haptic thimble, by providing the fingertip with a vibration of by squeezing it.

Haptic thimble anatomy
----------------------

The haptic thimble is composed of several components, including a motor, sensors, and some mechanical components. The motor is used to generate vibrations, which are then transmitted to the user by using sensors' data. The sensors detect the user's movements and provide feedback to the motor, allowing it to adjust the intensity of the force accordingly.

Applications for an haptic thimble
----------------------------------

The haptic thimble is used in a variety of applications, including virtual reality, gaming, and medical training. It can be used to simulate the feeling of touching objects in a virtual environment, allowing users to experience a more realistic and immersive experience.

Additionally, it can be used to provide tactile feedback during medical procedures, allowing doctors to practice their skills without putting patients at risk.
