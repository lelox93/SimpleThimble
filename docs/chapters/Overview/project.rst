AugmentedWearEdu Project
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The main objective of project is to introduce a novel framework for e-Learning consisting of including haptic experiences to enable digital access to laboratories in higher education. This will be achieved by combining both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) tools with a novel generation of wearable haptic devices. This combination of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology (using open-source software and simple physical devices) will make learning in a laboratory and hapto-audiovisual environment possible.

One of the biggest drawbacks of the majority of E-learning existing solutions, is that limited support is provided to hands-on laboratory work and practical experiences. Hands-on experiences are essential to significantly advance learning, especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments. The project AugmentedWearEdu will make it possible to engage students in a fully-immersive 3D virtual/augmented educational environment, contributing to performing lab work in a fully-immersive, open, and, most importantly, distance laboratory learning. 

Within this project, the SimpleThimble device will be used to provide haptic feedback to the user, allowing them to feel the virtual environment in a realistic way. The device will be used in combination with VR tools to create a fully immersive learning experience.
