VR application: how we will use the SimpleThimble in virtual reality
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this section we will see how to use the SimpleThimble in three emblematic virtual reality (VR) applications. 

To do this we will use `Unity <https://unity.com/>`_, one of the most popular IDEs for desinging both 2D and 3D 
applications, such as games but also VR scenarios. The idea is to give the readers the possibility of implementing different scenarios based on their level of expertise.

Here are the three applications we will develop:

- Move a virtual sphere on a surface populated with obstacles of varying shapes and heights.  
- Grasp a virtual object through the use of the `Leap Motion <https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/>`_.
- Grasp a virtual object through the use of the `Oculus Quest <https://www.oculus.com/quest/>`_.

.. note::
   The following tutorials differ from the the level of expertise required. The first one is the simplest, as it does not require any additional hardware. The second one requires the use of the Leap Motion controller, while the third one requires the use of the Oculus Quest. Moreover, the tutorials are structured in a way that each one can be followed independently of the others.
