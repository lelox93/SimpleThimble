VR Application: Grasp a Virtual Object through the Use of the Oculus Quest
==========================================================================

The Oculus Quest is a standalone VR headset made by `Meta <https://meta.com/>`_ that does not require a computer to run. It is a great device for VR applications, as it is wireless and has a good tracking system. The Oculus Quest uses inside-out tracking, which means that it uses cameras on the headset to track the position of the user in the physical space. This allows for a more immersive and interactive VR experience, as the user can move around freely without being tethered to a computer.
